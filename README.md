# CS3D5B - (Week 5-6)

Our app is a simple quiz app with a few questions and answer options contained in categories.
Our app contains a login page that prompts users for a username and a very basic Leaderboard. 
Our app also contains a planned, deliberate User Interface that is consistent throughout the app.
Our application has several options like a timer, a share button, a PVC mode.
We have also set up an online database.

Responsibilities for the project were as follows:

    Baptiste - replaced old question system to have a class not tied to the implementation of the storage
             - code cleanup and git maintenance(merging differents branches)

    Brendan - added the main activity mechanics
            - made question libraries

    David - worked on the overall design of the app and bug-bashing
          - created the timer functionnality of the app, consisting of the timer UI and the behavior of the questions changing when                  time for the question expires
          - worked on the audio component of the timer

    Margaux - added the option of choosing a picture of the user gallery and display it on every needed part of the app. The user can                now choose an avatar picture or a picture of his gallery
            - added a share button
            - changed the design of the button : when clicked the color of the button changes
            - identified and fixed some bugs of the app
