# CS3D5B

Our app is a simple quiz app with a few questions and answer options.
Our app contains a login page that prompts users for a username and a very basic Leaderboard.
Our app also contains a planned, deliberate User Interface that is consistent throughout the app.

Responsibilities for the project were as follows:
    Baptiste - create the Github repository, general support, and worked on the Leaderboard
    Brendan - created the question library (had trouble pushing so Baptiste pushed for him)
    David - worked on the overall design of the project and bug-bashing
    Margaux - worked on the Login page and Profile Picture selection feature
